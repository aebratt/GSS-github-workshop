# Why Git + GitHub


- Git is a **version control system**. It originally helped softward developers work collaboratively to develop products. 

--

- Git manages the evolution of a set of files (i.e., **repository**). It's like Google Docs in that you can restore the status of your files from, say, a week ago. 

--

- Allows you to work from any computer (e.g., the FSH computer labs)

--

- More organized than say, saving version 1, version 2, **...** version 1000 of a single file

--

- Functions as an auxiliary back up of your code (though it should not be your **only** backup!!!!)

---

# Why **not** Git + GitHub

- Painful to get set up the first time

--

- Change in workflow

--

- If you never need to share your project with others (none of us, probably)

---

# Why Git + GitHub

# How we use Git

---

# Basic workflow

--

- Create a new repository on GitHub

--

- Make a new RStudio project (select from Version Control and follow prompts)

--

- Go about your business

--

- Periodically **commit** saved changes you've made to Git. Commits are like snapshots of the entire project.

--

- Periodically **push** those commits to GitHub. Pusing syncs the local repo with the remote repo

---

# Basic workflow

.center[
```{r git-workflow, echo = FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("libs/imgs/Git Diagram.svg")
```
]

---

# Create a new repository on GitHub

1. In the upper-right corner of any page, use the  drop-down menu, and select New repository.

2. Type a name for your repository, and an optional description.

3. Choose a repository visibility.

.center[
```{r repo, echo = FALSE, out.width="50%"}
knitr::include_graphics("libs/imgs/create-repository-public-private.png")
```
]

---

# Create a new repository on GitHub

<ol start="4">
    <li>Add any optional items you want to pre-populate your repository with:</li>
</ol>

<UL>
<LI> README: A text document describing your project
<LI> .gitignore file: which is a set of ignore rules (described more later)
<LI> software license for your project <a href="https://choosealicense.com/">(see reference)</a>
</UL>

<ol start="5">
  <li>Click create repository</li>
</ol>

# Template repository

--

- What is a template repository: "A filing cabinet" repository

--

- A template repository enables users to:
  - Mark a repository as a template
  - Copy entire repository directory structure and files to a brand new repository
  - Share repository templates with other GitHub users

---

# Make and use a template repository

--

1. Create a new repository and put template in its name (e.g., project_template)

--

2. Add folders to the new repository (e.g., scripts, data, documents, presentations, etc.)

--

3. Then convert the repository as a template repository (in settings)

--

4. Create a brand new repository and use "project_template" as your template repository

--

- Let's try it out!

---

# Cache git credentials 

--

- When we interact with a remote Git server (GitHub) we have to include credentials to prove we are a specific GitHub user

--

- Git can communicate with a remote server using one of two protocols, HTTPS or SSH, and the different protocols use different credentials.

--

- Here we describe the credential setup for the SSH protocol. 

--

- HTTPS vs SSH?? read [here](https://ourtechroom.com/tech/https-vs-ssh-in-git/) or [ here](https://happygitwithr.com/https-pat.html#https-vs-ssh)

[reference 2](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/about-ssh)

---

# Check for existing SSH Keys

--

1. Open Git Bash (PC users) or your shell (Apple users)

--

2. Type: 

 ls -al ~/.ssh to see if existing SSH keys are present.

--

3. Check directory listing. If you have a public SSH key you will have one of the following file names: 

- id_rsa.pub 
- id_ecdsa.pub
- id_ed25519.pub 

.center[
```{r cache1, echo = FALSE, out.width="50%"}
knitr::include_graphics("libs/imgs/Cache1.PNG")
```
]

---

# Generate a new SSH Key

--

1. Open Git Bash/shell. Paste the text below, substituting in your GitHub email address: 

 ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com" 

--

2. When you're prompted to "Enter a file in which to save the key," press Enter. This accepts the default file location.

--

3. At the prompt, type a secure passphrase.

--

---

# Adding SSH key to the ssh-agent

--

1. Ensure the ssh-agent is running. By typing in the shell: 

 eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"

 You should get: Agent pid #s

--

2. Add your SSH private key to the ssh-agent. If you created your key with a different name, or if you are adding an existing key that has a different name, replace id_ed25519 in the command with the name of your private key file. Type in the shell: 

 ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_ed25519

---

# Adding SSH key to Github

--

1. Copy the SSH public key to your clipboard. In the shell type:

 clip < ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub

--

2. In Github, click your profile photo and click Settings

--

3. In the user settings sidebar, click SSH and GPG keys.

--

4. Click New SSH key or Add SSH key

--

5. In the "Title" field, add a descriptive label for the new key. (e.g., Personal laptop) 

--

6. Paste your key into the "Key" field.

--

7. Click Add SSH key.

--

---

# Finally... test your SSH connection!

--

1. Open Git Bash/shell 

--

2. Enter the following:  

 ssh -T git@github.com  
 
 You may see a warning like this:

 The authenticity of host 'github.com (IP ADDRESS)' can't be established.
 RSA key fingerprint is SHA256:nThbg6kXUpJWGl7E1IGOCspRomTxdCARLviKw6E5SY8.
 Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)?  
 
--

3. Verify that the fingerprint in the message you see matches GitHub's RSA public key fingerprint. If it does, then type yes:

 You should get the message: 
 
 Hi username! You've successfully authenticated, but GitHub does not provide shell access.

---

# Finally... test your SSH connection!

- Verify that the message contains your username. If you are denied permission see [here](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/troubleshooting-ssh/error-permission-denied-publickey)

---

# Make a new RStudio project

---

# Stage, commit, push

---

# Editing the `.gitignore` file

---

# Exercises

- Email [Abby](aebratt@uw.edu) your GitHub handle so she can add you to the repository for this workshop

- Create an SSH key in RStudio and store it in GitHub

- Clone the [repository](https://github.com/aebratt/GSS-github-workshop) for this workshop to your computer

- Make an R script titled `plot_*yourname*` inside the `scripts` folder that creates a plot of your choice using the data from the `data` folder. Stage, commit, and pull/push. 

- Check GitHub to see your file on the internet

---

# Resolve merge conflicts

- Merge conflict: when the same line in a same file has been edited in two different places

--

- Most common when working collaboratively

--

- Git handles most merges on its own with smart automatic merging features

--

- Sometimes, though they are not so smart

--

---

# Resolve merge conflicts

.center[
```{r git-conflictimage, echo = FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("libs/imgs/gitconflict.png")
```
]

[reference](https://coderefinery.github.io/git-intro/08-conflicts/)

---

# Resolve merge conflicts

- Git inserts resolution markers (the <<<<<<<, >>>>>>>, and =======).

.center[
```{r git-conflict1, echo = FALSE, out.width="50%"}
knitr::include_graphics("libs/imgs/ConflictR.PNG")
```
] 

---

# Resolve merge conflicts

--

.center[
```{r git-conflict2, echo = FALSE, out.width="20%"}
knitr::include_graphics("libs/imgs/ConflictR2.PNG")
```
] 

- We have to edit the code/text between the resolution markers. 

--

- Simple steps:

--

1. Decide what you keep (the one, the other, or both or something else). Edit the file to do this.

--

2. Remove the resolution markers, if not already done.  

--

3. The file(s) should now look exactly how you want them.

--

4. Stage, Commit, Pull, Push

---

# Exercises

- Pull from GitHub

- We will make groups of two going in alphabetical order by name. 

- Make an edit to your partner's plot file - communicate with your partner which **line** you are editing

- Then make an edit to your own plot file in the **same line** your partner edited

- Stage, commit, pull and push

- With your partner, resolve the resulting merge conflict

- Stage, commit, pull and push

---

# Advanced workflow

- Go about your business, per the basic workflow

--

- Have an idea for a new feature (e.g., different model structure)

--

- Create a new branch to explore it

--

- **If it pans out**, merge branch back with `main`

--

- **If it doesn't**, abandon it, and continue working on clean `main` branch

---

# Advanced workflow

.center[
```{r git-workflow2, echo = FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("libs/imgs/git-branches-merge.png")
```
]

---

# Create branch for feature development


---

# Issue a pull request

---

# Exercises

- Create a new branch titled `yourName`

- Add a new feature to the file `plot_*yourname*`

- Push changes to your branch to GitHub

- On GitHub, issue a pull request to merge your branch with the main branch

- Repo owner (Abby) will approve/deny the request

---

# Fixing a f*ck up - go back in time

**Small difference**

Copy and paste from **diff** 

--

**Big difference**

```git revert --no-commit *numberOfCommitYouWant*..HEAD```

or 

UNDO in GitKraken

---

# Fixing a f*ck up - really bad

Start with Google, but here is one effective, if inelegant, way:

- Push often, because the state on GitHub is your new "worst case scenario"

- If you really screw things up locally, copy all the files (or the ones that have changed) to a safe place.
Usually your files are JUST FINE. But it is easy to goof up the Git infrastructure when you’re new at this. And it can be hard to get that straightened out on your own.

- Rename the existing local repo as a temporary measure, (before you do something radical, like delete it)

- Clone the repo from GitHub to your local machine. You are back to a happy state.

- Copy all relevant files back over from your safe space. The ones whose updated state you need to commit.

- Stage and commit. Push. Carry on with your life.

---

# Exercises

- Practice burning it all down and re-cloning from GitHub using this workshop's repository as an example

---

# If we have time

- What to do if you have [large files](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/working-with-files/managing-large-files/about-large-files-on-github) (that you want on GitHub)
- A little bit of Git from the command line
- A little bit of Git from GitKraken
